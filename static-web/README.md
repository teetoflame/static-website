Deploying a Static Website to AWS EC2 with Nginx
This guide walks you through deploying a basic static website onto an AWS EC2 instance using Nginx as the web server.

Prerequisites
An AWS account with access to EC2 and IAM services.
Basic understanding of Linux commands and SSH.
A text editor for creating the website files (HTML and CSS).
Steps
Create an AWS EC2 Instance:

Launch an EC2 instance using your preferred Amazon Machine Image (AMI), such as Ubuntu Server.
Choose an appropriate instance type based on your expected website traffic.
Configure a security group to allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP).
Create a key pair for SSH access.
Connect to the Instance:

Use an SSH client (e.g., PuTTY) to connect to your EC2 instance using the private key you created.
Update and Install Nginx:

Update package lists:
Bash
sudo apt update
Use code with caution.

Install Nginx:
Bash
sudo apt install nginx
Use code with caution.

Create a Directory for Your Website:

Create a directory to hold your website files:
Bash
sudo mkdir mywebsite
Use code with caution.

Create Website Files:

Create two files named index.html and styles.css inside the mywebsite directory.
Add the following content to index.html:
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Personal Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is My Personal Project</h1>
    <p>Created by Victor Okonkwo</p>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Add the following content to styles.css:
CSS
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Light gray background */
}

h1 {
    color: #3498db; /* Blue */
    font-size: 36px;
}

p {
    color: #666;
    font-size: 18px;
}
Use code with caution.

Configure NGINX:

Open the default NGINX configuration file for editing:
Bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Use code with caution.

Replace the default content with the following configuration, adjusting paths as needed:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_name; # Replace with your domain name or server IP

    root /home/ubuntu/mywebsite;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
Test NGINX Configuration and Restart:

Check for configuration errors:
Bash
sudo nginx -t
Use code with caution.

Restart Nginx:
Bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Use code with caution.

Access Your Website:

Open a web browser and enter your EC2 instance's public IP address or your domain name (if configured). You should see your website.
Additional Notes
Consider security measures like firewalls, SSH key-based authentication, and regular security updates.
Explore performance optimization techniques like image compression, CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), and caching strategies.
Investigate scaling options for increased website traffic (e.g., using load balancers).
Implement website monitoring tools to track performance and resource usage.
This guide serves as a basic starting point. You can customize it further by adding more website content, exploring advanced Nginx configurations, and implementing security best practices.
